# Interactive Application
v1.0 Udacity Practice Set 2B - Coffee shop order

# Description
Apart from the usual XML UI + Java functionality practice, in set 2B of this course, I was introduced to Implicit Intents in Android. The application lets a user enter his name, select coffee toppings and coffee count. Then displays summary and via Intent, all relevant order information is sent to an email app to be sent as order via email to coffee shop's email-order server.
